# Dungeon Quest GB
Simple game concept to test GB capabilities.

## Complementary Software
I'm using two amazing tools made by Harry Mulder to design the tiles and maps and I really recommend that you check them out.

## Compile Instructions

Run make.sh on Linux shell.

In some cases it may be necessary to allow the script to run:

```
chmod +x make.sh
```

## Running

Get the output main.gb file and open it on any GB emulator or flash drive.
